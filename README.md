# UniShop
## 🛒 ML-Powered E-Commerce Platform ----->  https://unishop.mavoid.com/

A machine learning-driven e-commerce system designed to deliver **personalized product recommendations** based on user behavior and product similarities. This project integrates **deep learning** for price prediction and a **recommendation engine** to enhance the online shopping experience.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Product Price Range Prediction**: Built a deep learning model to predict product **price range categories** using product metadata.
- 🛍️ **Personalized Recommendations**: Developed a recommendation system that suggests products based on the **similarity to items visited** by the user.
- 📈 **User Behavior Analysis**: The system learns from user interactions to deliver more relevant product suggestions over time.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🧠 Deep Learning model for **multi-class classification** of product prices.
- 🔄 Recommendation engine based on **product similarity** (e.g., category, brand, features).
- 📊 Data analysis to understand product trends and customer interests.
- 🎯 Personalized suggestions to boost user engagement and satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Recommendation Systems** (Cosine Similarity, Content-Based Filtering)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and experiments
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, and normalization.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Trained a model to classify product price ranges.
3. **Recommendation System**: Used similarity metrics to recommend similar products to visited ones.
4. **Evaluation**: Measured model accuracy, loss, and recommendation quality.
5. **Visualization**: Plotted performance metrics and feature analysis.
